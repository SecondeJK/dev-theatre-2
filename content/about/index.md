## Hi, I'm James!

![James with his records](/img/jimrecords.jpg)

From Theatre Graduate, to QA, to SQL data analyst, to Business Intelligence Developer, to Web Developer, to Developer Advocate. From the stage and back to the stage, I sit in a happy medium between tech and theatre. I also pretended to be a DJ on the way.

I founded Birmingham's current PHP usergroup, brumPHP, and host/co-run a quarterly tech conference, Fusion Birmingham led by and founded by the Fusion Group.

I am a Senior Developer Advocate in PHP at global Cloud Communications company Vonage.

I write and speak on PHP, Developer Culture and DevOps Tooling.

I don't like mumble rap.
